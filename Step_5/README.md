# Step 5 - Analysis

This directory contains all files related to the analyses. All analyses were conducted in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). This directory can be imported as a project in [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

In the directory `./data/`, you will find the data related to the datasets of issues (`processed_issues.csv`), PRs (`prs_characterization.csv`), and monitoring (`prs_monitoring.csv`). Meanwhile, the analysis files are located in the directory `./reports/`, comprising four: `characterizing_prs.Rmd` (PRs characterization), `issues_characterization.Rmd` (issues characterization), `monitoring_analysis.Rmd` (monitoring data analysis), and `rq_answers.Rmd` (analysis related to the two research questions).
